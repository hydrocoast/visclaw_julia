# VisClaw with Julia
This repository aims to become one of the Clawpack visualization tools (see http://www.clawpack.org).  
This allows us to make animations with the Julia language.   
Please contact the author if you find a bug.  

# Requirements
## Julia Packages
- Julia v1.0.0
- Plots
- PyPlot  (GR is also available)

## Others  
In order to make animations, the following softwares are necessary.  
- bash
- convert (ImageMagick)
- ffmpeg

# Usage Examples
In preparation, set a variable `CLAW` in `CLAWPATH.jl`  
```julia
CLAW="../clawpack" # path to your clawpack directory
```
This process can be skipped when OS is Linux.

## Chile 2010 Tsunami
- execute the example of `chile2010` in your clawpack
- update flags to meet your requirements in `example_chile2010.jl`
```julia
#= boolgauge[load,plot,print] =#
boolgauge = [1,1,1] .|> Bool
```
- start REPL and execute
```julia
include("./example_chile2010.jl")
```

The following animation and figures can be generated by `example_chile2010.jl`

## Hurricane Ike
- execute the example of `ike` in your clawpack, as is the case of `chile2010`
- update flags to meet your requirements in `example_ike.jl`
- start REPL and execute
```julia
include("./example_ike.jl")
```

## Easy Check
`easycheck.jl` enables to scan quickly water surface elevation at certain times.
```plain
julia> include("./easycheck.jl")
Input anything but integer if you want to exit.
The final step: 19
input the number (1 to 19) =
```

# Ongoing and Future Work
`Plots` package has some [issues](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20colorbar) on colorbar.  
Further application and less dependence on the Plots can be expected by plotting with other packages.  
This repo is now being developed so that figures can be pretty and drawn faster using [GMT.jl](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/GMT.jl).
